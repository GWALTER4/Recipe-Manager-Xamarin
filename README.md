# Recipe Manager Application

Recipe manager mobile application made for my undergraduate dissertation. The purpose of my project was to create two identical
applications one using Xamarin.Forms and the other using Android Studio and compare the development process and technical 
performance for the two apps. This is the Xamarin.Forms application.

The application allows the user to create categories and later create recipes under each category. The app stores the name,
instructions, and duration for each recipe. The user can also choose to add a photo to each recipe that will appear next to 
the recipe name on the category page.
